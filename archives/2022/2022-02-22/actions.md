There is trouble in the once so prosperous lands of Landusia. Your good friend Tonan, the wizard, is locked-up in Clovar's castle, guarded by an evil monster. You have travelled to Landusia to free him from the beast.

You are currently in the vast oak forests on the foothills of the Mansoer mountains. The castle is far to the south-east of your current position. Beware of the swooping crows!

To play this game, you can use the following instructions: look, take, put, use, kill and wait. Some verbs are used in combination with objects, such as "take knife". To move around Landusia, use the compass directions and up and down.
## victory
Hip, Hip ... Hurray! You have found Tonan's treasure!
## death
You have succumbed to your wounds. You feel your life juices slowly draining away. The world gradually fades to black, and you realise that your miserable life has come to an end.

GAME OVER!
