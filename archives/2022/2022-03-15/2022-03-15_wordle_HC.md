## Wordle Data

Wordle is a daily online brain-teaser game, currently hosted by the New
York Times. Each day, players must guess a mystery 5 letter word in 6
attempts or less to pass. For every guess, letters turn green if they
are in the correct place, yellow if they are in the mystery word but in
the wrong place, and grey if they are incorrect. Wordle has become
incredibly popular in the past few months, going from 90 (early Jan
2022) to over 2 million (mid Jan 2022) people playing every day and
sharing their scores online.

(See wordle\_data\_HC for the creation of these data)

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
pacman::p_load(install = FALSE, update = FALSE, tidyverse, plotly, ggimage, ggalt, ggpubr, shiny, shinythemes, pipeR, plotly, wordcloud)

w_words <- read.csv("D:\\Tidy_Tuesday\\Wordle\\2022-03-15_wordle_HC\\wordle_words.csv")

# https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/english-word-frequency
uni_freq <- read.csv("D:\\Tidy_Tuesday\\Wordle\\2022-03-15_wordle_HC\\unigram_freq.csv") 

# sentiment nrc

nrc <- read.csv("D:\\Tidy_Tuesday\\Wordle\\2022-03-15_wordle_HC\\nrc_sentiment.csv")
nrc <- nrc %>% select(word, Positive, Negative, Anger, Anticipation, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Trust)
```

``` r
# join uni_freq
  # rename columns 
w_words1 <- w_words %>% 
  rename(word = answer)
  # lowercase 
w_words1$word <- tolower(w_words1$word) 
  # join 
w_answ_freq <- left_join(w_words1, uni_freq) %>% 
  rename(word_freq = count)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
# join the sentiment data
wordle_nrc <- left_join(w_answ_freq, nrc) %>% 
  na.omit() 
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

After reading in the files with the data I’m interested in, and joining
various datasets, I decided to see which Wordle answers have the highest
letter frequency scores.

``` r
w_words %>% 
  select(answer, letter_freq_total, mean_attempts) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  slice_max(letter_freq_total, n = 10)
```

    ##    answer letter_freq_total mean_attempts
    ## 1   SWEET             41.51      4.263666
    ## 2   THOSE             41.00      3.625605
    ## 3   OTHER             40.74      3.945170
    ## 4   AHEAD             38.50      4.232542
    ## 5   ELDER             38.36      4.575236
    ## 6   SHIRE             37.55      3.841601
    ## 7   TACIT             36.34      4.193510
    ## 8   TROVE             35.93      4.365700
    ## 9   THORN             35.67      3.529608
    ## 10  PLEAT             35.04      3.863466

Then, I thought a better way to show this would be to use a word cloud.

``` r
w_words %>%
  select(answer, letter_freq_total) %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  with(wordcloud(answer, letter_freq_total, scale=c(1.8,0.1), colors = "#AD1DA5")) 
```

![](2022-03-15_wordle_HC_files/figure-gfm/word%20clouds%20letter%20freq-1.png)<!-- -->

I also made a word cloud for the word frequency…

``` r
w_answ_freq %>%
  select(word, word_freq) %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  with(wordcloud(word, word_freq, scale=c(5,1), colors = "#FF5100")) 
```

![](2022-03-15_wordle_HC_files/figure-gfm/word%20cloud%20word%20freq-1.png)<!-- -->

… as well as for the mean scores.

``` r
w_words %>%
  select(answer, mean_attempts) %>%
  distinct() %>% 
  with(wordcloud(answer, mean_attempts, scale=c(1.6,0.05), color = "#01AF64")) 
```

Next, I wanted to view various trends in the data.

``` r
# character attempts (for geom area)
w_answ_freq$attempts <- as.character(w_answ_freq$attempts)

ggplot(w_answ_freq, aes(x = letter_freq_total, y = perc_attempts, fill = attempts)) +
  geom_area() +
  labs(y = 'Percentage Per Score', 
       x = "Letter Frequency Scores", 
       title = "Wordle Score Distribution Across Letter Frequency")

Then, I decided to see if word sentiment impacted Wordle scores.

``` r
wordle_nrc1 <- wordle_nrc %>% 
  select(word, mean_attempts, attempts, perc_attempts, Positive, Negative)%>%
  filter(Positive==1|Negative==1) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Positive:Negative, names_to = 'valence', values_to = "Yes/No") %>%

  select(valence, val_mean) %>% 
  distinct()

ggplot(wordle_nrc1, aes(x = valence, y = val_mean, fill = valence)) +

       x = "Valence", 
       title = "Wordle Mean Scores By Valence")

## How to cheat in Wordle

``` r
# https://www.kaggle.com/bcruise/wordle-valid-words?select=valid_solutions.csv
valid_solutions <- read.csv("D:\\Tidy_Tuesday\\Wordle\\2022-03-15_wordle_HC\\valid_solutions.csv")

w_solutions1 <- left_join(valid_solutions, uni_freq) %>% 
  mutate(letters = word) %>% 
  separate(letters, into = c("L0", "L1", "L2", "L3", "L4", "L5"), sep = "") %>% 
  select(-L0) %>% 
  rename(word_freq = count)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

Firstly, I tried to make a shiny app, however I ran into many problems.
- every slot needed to have a value. I set a default value to something
common for all words (i.e. a “.” at the end).

-   but, the str\_detect was not a fan of ! or negate = TRUE for both
    the “.” and regular letters, I have no idea why.

-   as I couldn’t come up with a solution, I decided to try to make 1
    function.

``` r
x <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r",
       "s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z")

wordle_helper <- function(data, GL1=".", GL2=".", GL3=".", GL4=".", GL5=".", YL1=".", YL2=".", YL3=".", YL4=".", YL5=".", YLM=".", Grey="."){
  data1 <- data %>% 
    filter(
      if(GL1 != "."){L1 %in% GL1} 
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(GL2 != "."){L2 %in% GL2} 
      else {L1 %in% x}, 
      if(GL3 != "."){L3 %in% GL3} 
      else {L1 %in% x}, 
      if(GL4 != "."){L4 %in% GL4} 
      else {L1 %in% x}, 
      if(GL5 != "."){L5 %in% GL5}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL1 != "."){str_detect(word, YL1)}
      else {L1 %in% x}, 
      if(YL2 != "."){str_detect(word, YL2)} 
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL3 != "."){str_detect(word, YL3)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL4 != "."){str_detect(word, YL4)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL5 != "."){str_detect(word, YL5)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YLM != "."){str_detect(word, YLM)} #misc
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL1 != "."){!str_detect(L1, YL1)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL2 != "."){!str_detect(L2, YL2)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL3 != "."){!str_detect(L3, YL3)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL4 != "."){!str_detect(L4, YL4)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(YL5 != "."){!str_detect(L5, YL5)}
      else {L1 %in% x},
      if(Grey != "."){!str_detect(word, Grey)}
      else {L1 %in% x}) %>% 
    arrange(-word_freq)
  return(print(data1$word))}

# Green e.g., GL1 = "x"
# Yellow e.g., YL1 = "x" 
  # Yellow Misc. e.g., YLM = "x" OR [xxxx]"
# Grey e.g., Grey = "x" OR "[xxxx]"

# GL1=".", GL2=".", GL3=".", GL4=".", GL5=".", YL1=".", YL2=".", YL3=".", YL4=".", YL5=".", YLM=".", Grey="."

wordle_helper(data = w_solutions1, GL1="a", YL2="a", Grey="[ioled]")
```

    ##  [1] "array" "apart" "angry" "assay" "angst" "abyss" "artsy" "awash" "aback"
    ## [10] "aunty" "amass" "augur"

``` r
# add YLM="m",

wordle_helper(data = w_solutions1, GL1="s", YL2="l", YL4="t", YL5="[e]", Grey="a")
```

    ## [1] "steel" "spelt" "smelt"

``` r
# add YLM="m",

# str_detect YLs doesnt make multiple listed compulsory 
  # make YL a list, and do a loop of str_detect filters?
```

However, after getting excited that I have just invented the newest app
sensation, I quickly realised that this function had no way of dealing
with multiple yellow letters in the same position. str\_detect treats
detecting characters as x or y, not x and y. Hence, I added a
miscellaneous yellow letter argument to compromise.

But ultimately becasue compromises suck, I tried to have the function
loop through the multiple characters in a string of possible yellow
letters. This turned out to be a very painful experience.

Here are some of my attempts to make this work.

Exhibit A: the turducken

``` r
# if(YL1 != "."){
#        for (i in seq_along(YL1)){
#          str_detect(word, YL1[i])}} 
#      else {L1 %in% x}, 
```

Exhibit B: the anti-pipe duo

``` r
#  if(YL1 != "."){
#    data2 <- data1 %>%
#      for (i in seq_along(YL1)){
#        filter(str_detect(data1$word, YL1[i]))}} 
#   else {data2 <- data1 %>% filter(L1 %in% x)}
```

Exhibit C: the Dory

``` r
# if(a1 != "."){
#  for (i in seq_along(a1)){
#    data6 <- data5 %>% filter(str_detect(word, a1[i]))}
#  } else {data6 <- data5 %>% filter(L1 %in% x)}
```

Exhibit D: the elephant behind a pole

``` r
# YL_yes <- function(YL) {
#  for (i in seq_along(YL)){
#    str_detect(word, YL[i])}}

# YL_pos <- function(YL) {
#  for (i in seq_along(YL)){
#    !str_detect(L1, YL[i])}}
```

Exhibit E: Episode IV - a new hope

``` r
# Green 
greenL <- function(.data, pos, letter) {
  .data %>% 
    filter({{pos}} %in% letter)
}

# Yellow
yellowL <- function(.data, pos, letter) {
  .data %>% 
    filter(str_detect(word, letter)) %>% 
    filter(!str_detect({{pos}}, letter))
}

# Grey 
greyL <- function(.data, letter) {
  .data %>% 
    filter(!str_detect(word, letter))
}

# greenL(L, "") %>% 
# yellowL(L, "") %>% 
# greyL("[]") %>%

w_solutions1 %>% 
  yellowL(L1, "r") %>% 
  greenL(L2, "o") %>% 
  yellowL(L4, "u") %>% # need this double Y in L4
  yellowL(L4, "n") %>%
  greyL("[slated]") %>% 
  arrange(-word_freq) %>% 
  pull(word)
```
